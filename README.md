# GigMeBackend

Welcome!

I have previously built a prototype to this platform that I was unhappy with, so I am going to rebuild it with better code.

If you want to test my progress you can fork this repo and clone it locally.

open the cloned directory in your editor and from the terminal run:
 npm install
 npm start

you should then be able to make HTTP requests to the API successfully.

I will update as I keep building.

Thank you and enjoy!
